# üè†üè† Flutter Ghor Chai App


Our project will help us to find a house on rent easily for renter and it will also help us to give house rent easily. We are adding maps in our project. When we open our app it shows us a map where we can see many houses and hotels in our map if the owner had registered on our site or something else then our app will lead them to a house or hotel for them on rent. Our map will show them ways how to go there. We will add AI to our project. It will help us to get real time updates. We will add an image and video showdown which will allow us to find houses as we desire. We face some problems with paying house rent. We are also having an advanced rent payment method in our project so that renters can pay advanced payment and rent payment online or through a bank.
